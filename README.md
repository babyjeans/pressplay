# PressPlay

PressPlay was intended to be a 2D Strategy / Simulation game written for [löve2d][love2d] in Lua. It was my intended [Ludum Dare 36][ld36] submission, but I didn't finish it on time which is pretty par for the course.

Since the theme of [LD36][ld36] was _Ancient Technology_ I had decided that VCRs were ancient enough for me, and set out to make a game that was similar to [Papers, Please][pp] but in a light-hearted, "I'm fixing VCRs" way. This is how far I got, not quite all the way there. Like [brewwitch] I hope that this is of use as a learning tool or something, to someone. So here's some code to read!
